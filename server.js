// CHANGELOG
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// v1.20.3 — Rewrote fetchYoutubeTranscript: tries timedtext fmt=srv3 (XML)
//            across multiple languages first, then falls back to captions API
//            list + srv3. Previous json3 format caused "Unexpected end of JSON"
//            errors on many videos.
//
// v1.20.2 — YouTube scanning limits.
//            - Videos longer than 10 minutes are rejected with a clear message.
//            - Live/streaming videos are rejected with a clear message.
//            Both checks use the YouTube Data API v3 video metadata endpoint.
//
// v1.20.1 — Switched to YouTube Data API v3.
//            package (blocked by YouTube CAPTCHA on cloud IPs) to YouTube Data
//            API v3 + timedtext endpoint. Requires YOUTUBE_API_KEY env var.
//            Removed youtube-transcript dependency from package.json.
//
// v1.20.0 — YouTube transcript support.
//              falls back to manual text entry if no transcript available.
//            - News articles with embedded YouTube videos: transcripts fetched
//              and appended to article text automatically. If no transcript
//              available, analysis proceeds on article text only with a note.
//            - YouTube added as a platform in detectPlatform().
//
// v1.19.4 — bug fix: posts column missing from clusters/list SELECT query.
//            posts were being saved correctly but never returned.
//
// v1.19.3 — clusters store full posts array.
//            overallScore, ts) so admin can reconstruct client clusters without
//            needing client's localStorage.
//
// v1.19.2 — clusters/list device_id filter.
//            passes its own device_id to see only its clusters; admin omits it
//            to see all.
//
// v1.19.1 — seeded 32 default FAQs.
//            Terminology, Scanning logic, Technical, Privacy).
//
// v1.19.0 — connections column, FAQ endpoints.
//            postCount now includes isolated posts; FAQ table + GET /faq/list,
//            POST /faq/save, DELETE /faq/:id endpoints.
//
// v1.18.3 — PATCH /clusters/rename.
//
// v1.18.2 — isolated_post_ids added to clusters.
//            omitted posts identically to the live investigation view.
//
// v1.18.1 — postSummaries added to synthesize.
//            post_summaries column added to clusters table; clusters/save and
//            clusters/list updated accordingly.
//
// v1.18.0 — Clusters history.
//            GET /clusters/list. Cluster IDs generated client-side same format
//            as post IDs (WBT-CLU-...).
//
// v1.17.5 — Buffer-based unicode sanitization.
//            surrogates from Hebrew/Arabic/emoji text in both detect and synthesize.
//
// v1.17.4 — Sanitize post text before sending to API — removes unpaired
//            Unicode surrogates (emoji, Arabic/Hebrew chars) that caused 400 errors.
//
// v1.17.3 — Better error logging in investigate/detect to surface root cause.
//
// v1.17.2 — Fixed extractJSON to handle JSON arrays.
//            investigation detection which returns an array of pair results).
//
// v1.17.1 — Optimized investigation token usage.
//            batches 4 pairs per call, and uses trimmed prompts (~75% cost
//            reduction vs v1.17.0). Stage 2 prompt also trimmed.
//
// v1.17.0 — Investigation endpoints.
//            connection detection per post pair) and POST /investigate/synthesize
//            (Stage 2 — synopsis + cluster name for connected posts).
//
// v1.16.2 — Strip citation markup from actor bio returned by web_search tool.
//
// v1.16.1 — Refresh endpoint: use Promise.allSettled so one entity failure
//            doesn't kill the whole batch; graceful JSON parse error handling.
//
// v1.16.0 — Entity refresh endpoint: POST /entities/refresh takes an array
//            of entities, queries Claude with web search for each, returns
//            changed fields and change descriptions.
//
// v1.15.1 — Robust JSON extraction for actor/publication research.
//            Claude preamble text before JSON (e.g. "Based on my research...").
//
// v1.15.0 — Token tracking: all Claude API calls now log input/output tokens.
//            input_tokens/output_tokens columns added to scans and actors tables.
//            /stats endpoint returns token totals broken down by post/actor/source.
//            Token counts included in fetch-and-analyze and research-actor responses.
//
// v1.14.0 — Entity format compacted for ~15-20% token savings.
//            reduced per-field char limits, comments only when present.
//            ~15-20% fewer input tokens per scan, no impact on scoring.
//
// v1.13.0 — News website support, actors DB, publication research.
//            text via OpenGraph + article body scraping. Hybrid publication
//            research: static DB for 35+ major outlets, Claude web search
//            for unknown outlets. Actor research updated to include
//            publication profile for news URLs. Actors table in PostgreSQL:
//            saves all actor searches with source, deviceId, actor/publication
//            data. New GET /actors/list endpoint for admin history.
//            Actor research now uses web_search tool for better results.
//
// v1.12.4 — Added whosbehindthat.com to CORS allowed origins.
//
// v1.12.3 — Translation prompt improved.
//            (1) Beneficiary chain — when A is attacked, A's rival scores
//            high even if never mentioned. Fixes zero-alignment on posts
//            that only attack rivals without naming the beneficiary.
//            (2) Preference/ranking lists — "X over 1000 Y" scores X high.
//            (3) Sarcasm detection — assume literal intent unless explicit
//            irony markers are present. Don't second-guess genuine posts.
//
// v1.12.0 — Context scoring + Facebook UA improvements.
//
// v1.10.4 — Facebook/Instagram redirect following, lower min text threshold.
//
// v1.9.0  — Instagram fetching via Puppeteer headless browser. Restored
//            oEmbed + OpenGraph scraping with 200-char minimum check.
//            Pre-translation for Hebrew/Arabic. Language-aware scoring.
//            Intra-coalition criticism rule. Entity relationship modeling
//            + coherence check. All changes from app v1.10.x–v1.12.x.
//
// v1.8.0  — Added /research-actor endpoint (Claude OSINT actor lookup).
//
// v1.7.0  — Primary/secondary alignment distinction. "Criticism ≠ alignment"
//            rule. alignment field mandatory on all matches.
//
// v1.6.0  — Batched scoring (10 per call), temperature:0, threshold 60%.
//
// v1.5.1  — Fixed PostgreSQL silent connection failure.
//
// v1.5.0  — Shared history via PostgreSQL. /history/save, /history/list,
//            /history/comment. Scan IDs. Version tracking. Comments field.
//
// v1.4.0  — Scoring prompt rewritten to narrative alignment framing.
//            Added "missing" context field per entity match.
//
// v1.3.0  — Scoring weights: interest 55%, MO 35%, narrative 10%.
//
// v1.2.0  — Core scoring engine: /fetch-and-analyze, /analyze, /fetch-post.
//
// v1.1.0  — Initial deployment: Express, CORS, health check, Anthropic key.

        // Terminology
        [1,'What is an entity?','An entity is any political actor, organization, government, movement, or ideological group whose interests the tool tracks. Examples include Benjamin Netanyahu, The Palestinian Authority, The US government, the IDF, or the Israeli protest movement. Each entity has a defined profile — their known interests, tactics, and public narrative — that the AI uses to score whether a given post serves their agenda.','Terminology',1],
        [2,'What is an actor?','An actor is the person or account behind a specific post — the author. When you research an actor, Who\'s Behind That? builds a profile of who they are: their background, known affiliations, political stance, and online presence. For news articles, actor research also profiles the publication itself — its editorial line, ownership, and known biases.','Terminology',2],
        [3,'What is primary vs secondary alignment?','Primary alignment means the post actively serves an entity\'s interests — its framing, message, or targets work in their favor. Secondary alignment means the entity benefits indirectly — the post wasn\'t necessarily crafted for them, but spreading it helps them nonetheless. Think of primary as "this post works for them" and secondary as "they\'d be happy this post exists." Important to note: alignment does not mean the post was commissioned by the entity, that the author works for them, or that there\'s any direct connection — it simply reflects whose interests the content serves, intentionally or not.','Terminology',3],
        [4,'What is Hidden Convergent Interest?','Hidden Convergent Interest is when two entities that are normally on opposite sides of the conflict both benefit from the same post — even if neither is the obvious intended audience. It reflects the idea that in a complex political landscape, a single piece of content can serve multiple agendas simultaneously, sometimes in ways that aren\'t immediately obvious. When Who\'s Behind That? detects this, it flags it as a separate finding so you can see not just who the post was likely written for, but also who quietly benefits from it being spread.','Terminology',4],
        [5,'What is a Frame?','A Frame is the wide, ongoing context that a post sits within — broader than a single event, it\'s the overarching situation that gives the content its meaning. Examples include "the war with Iran" or "the Israeli elections." A Frame can contain many Events, and understanding which Frame a post belongs to helps identify whether it connects to other posts about the same situation.','Terminology',5],
        [6,'What is an Event?','An Event is a specific, time-bounded happening that readers will immediately recognize — something like October 7th, the Nasrallah assassination, or the Hezbollah pager attack. Events sit within a broader Frame. A post scored as being "about" a particular Event is a candidate for connection with other posts about the same Event.','Terminology',6],
        [7,'What is a Connection?','A Connection is the specific relationship detected between exactly two posts — what ties them together narratively. A connection exists when two posts share the same framing goal, show signs of coordination, reinforce each other\'s narrative, or form a meaningful pattern together. Not every pair of posts about the same topic has a connection — the relationship needs to be meaningful, not just topical.','Terminology',7],
        [8,'What is a Cluster?','A Cluster is a group of posts that are all meaningfully connected to each other — directly or through shared connections. When you run an investigation, posts that pass the connection threshold are grouped into clusters. Posts that don\'t connect to any others remain isolated and are excluded from the synopsis.','Terminology',8],
        [9,'What is a Synopsis?','A Synopsis is the synthesized narrative output generated for a connected cluster — a short text that describes what story is being told across the posts, what framing pattern emerges, and whose interests it serves. A Synopsis is only generated when real connections are found. If no connections exist in a batch of posts, no Synopsis is produced.','Terminology',9],
        // Scanning logic
        [10,'How does post scanning work?','When you submit a URL, the server automatically fetches the text of the post or article. That text is then analyzed by Claude AI, which scores it against all entities in the database simultaneously. Each entity is evaluated based on whether the post advances their strategic interests, matches their known methods, and echoes their public narrative. The highest-scoring entities above the threshold appear as primary or secondary alignments.','Scanning logic',1],
        [11,'How does actor scanning work?','After a successful post scan, you\'re offered the option to research the account or author behind it. The server looks up publicly available information about them — their background, known affiliations, political stance, and online presence. For news articles, it also profiles the publication: its editorial line, ownership, and known biases. Results are generally accurate for well-known public figures but may be limited for anonymous or low-profile accounts.','Scanning logic',2],
        [12,'Does the scan consider context beyond the post text?','Each scan is based solely on the post or article being analyzed — it is not influenced by the author\'s other posts, past scans, or any external context outside of what\'s in the text itself. That said, the engine considers two dimensions within the post: what it says (content) and who it attacks (context). If a post directly attacks a named political figure, the engine identifies who benefits from that attack and factors that into the score. Actor research is separate — it adds background on the author for your own interpretation, but does not feed back into the post\'s scoring.','Scanning logic',3],
        [13,'Can you scan an actor without scanning a post first?','Not currently — actor research is triggered from a post scan result. This is intentional: Who\'s Behind That? is designed to analyze how content is framed, not to investigate individuals in isolation. The actor profile provides useful background for interpreting a specific scan, but the post itself is always the starting point.','Scanning logic',4],
        [14,'Why do some posts score 0%?','A zero score means the AI found no meaningful alignment with any entity above the detection threshold. This can happen when a post is genuinely neutral or factual, when the content is too vague or short to score reliably, or occasionally when the model misses context it should have caught — particularly for posts that rely heavily on irony, cultural shorthand, or implicit references. If you believe a zero result is wrong, feel free to contact us.','Scanning logic',5],
        [15,'What does the score percentage mean?','The score reflects how strongly a post serves a given entity\'s interests, on a scale of 0 to 100. It combines three factors: strategic interest alignment, tactical fingerprint, and narrative echo. Only entities scoring above 85% appear in your results — below that threshold the signal is considered too weak to be meaningful.','Scanning logic',6],
        [16,'What\'s the difference between scanning a social media post and a news article?','Both are analyzed the same way — the text is scored against the entity database to detect whose narrative it serves. The difference is in what you\'re measuring: a social media post reflects what an individual chose to say and how they framed it; a news article reflects how a publication chose to cover a story, what angle it took, and what it emphasized or left out. Both are valid and meaningful signals.','Scanning logic',7],
        [17,'I think the scan results were wrong','AI scoring is imperfect. The model may miss context, misread sarcasm, or fail to identify an indirect beneficiary — especially for posts that are ambiguous, highly local, or rely on cultural knowledge. If you consistently see wrong results for a certain type of post, you can contact us — it helps improve the model.','Scanning logic',8],
        [18,'Are the entities interchangeable?','Yes — the entity database is designed to evolve with the political landscape. Entities can be added, edited, split, or removed to reflect new developments, shifting alliances, emerging figures, or entirely new topics. The database is versioned, so you can always see which version was used for any given scan.','Scanning logic',9],
        [19,'How up to date is the entity database?','The database is updated periodically to reflect the current political landscape — new parties, splits, emerging figures, and shifting alliances. Each version is numbered, and every scan records which database version was used, so you can always trace results back to the entity set that produced them.','Scanning logic',10],
        [20,'Can Who\'s Behind That? work for other topics?','Yes — in principle the tool can be adapted to any topic where narrative alignment matters. Currently it\'s built specifically for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israeli domestic politics, and the results are most reliable within that scope. Applying it to other conflicts or political landscapes would require building a dedicated entity database for that domain, which is something we\'re open to exploring.','Scanning logic',11],
        [21,'Are the entities static or dynamic?','The entity database is reviewed on a weekly basis and updated when meaningful developments occur — such as election results, shifting alliances, new political figures, or major strategic changes. Minor day-to-day news doesn\'t trigger updates; only changes that genuinely affect an entity\'s interests or behavior do.','Scanning logic',12],
        // Technical
        [22,'What languages are supported?','Posts in Hebrew and Arabic are automatically detected and pre-translated before scoring, with political context extracted as part of the process. English posts are scored directly. Other languages may work but results are less reliable.','Technical',1],
        [23,'How does the Investigate feature work?','The Investigate tab lets you cross-analyze multiple posts together to detect narrative patterns that wouldn\'t be visible from a single scan. You add posts to an investigation basket from your history or directly from a scan result, then run the investigation when ready. The process works in two stages: first, every pair of posts is evaluated for a meaningful connection — same framing, coordinated narrative, or escalating pattern. Pairs that pass the threshold form clusters. Second, each cluster gets a synthesized synopsis describing what narrative is being constructed and whose interests it serves. Posts with no detected connections are excluded and noted separately. The basket persists across sessions so you can build an investigation over time.','Technical',2],
        [24,'What platforms are supported? Does scanning work the same for all?','Who\'s Behind That? supports posts from X (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram, as well as articles from major news and media websites including Ynet, Haaretz, Times of Israel, BBC, Al Jazeera, New York Times, and many others. The analysis itself works the same way across all platforms — once the text is retrieved, it goes through the same scoring process regardless of source. That said, every platform is built differently, and some are more restrictive than others when it comes to automated access. If scanning from a particular platform doesn\'t work, manually copying and pasting the text is always an option.','Technical',3],
        [25,'I got an error when trying to scan a post','Who\'s Behind That? can only access publicly available content. Private social media posts, friends-only content, closed groups, and articles behind a paywall cannot be fetched — in those cases, you can paste the text manually instead. For Facebook and Instagram specifically, automated access is sometimes temporarily blocked by the platform — copying and pasting the post text manually is the best workaround. If the server is waking up from sleep, waiting 30 seconds and trying again usually resolves the issue.','Technical',4],
        [26,'Does actor scanning count toward my daily quota?','Yes — each actor research uses one of your daily credits, the same as a post scan. This is because it involves an AI call which has a real cost.','Technical',5],
        [27,'Can Who\'s Behind That? integrate with other platforms via API?','We\'d love to make that possible. API access isn\'t available yet — the tool is currently a web app only — but if you\'re interested in integration for research, journalism, or institutional use, we\'d be happy to hear from you at contact@whosbehindthat.com.','Technical',6],
        // Privacy
        [28,'Is login or identification required?','No login, account, or registration is required. Who\'s Behind That? uses a randomly generated device identifier stored in your browser to track your daily scan quota and link your local history — nothing more. There is no user profile, no email address, and no authentication of any kind. You can start scanning immediately.','Privacy',1],
        [29,'Is Who\'s Behind That? free?','Yes — Who\'s Behind That? is free to use during the beta period. There are no subscription fees, no payment required, and no premium tier. The tool is currently limited to 10 scans per day per device to manage API costs, but this limit may be adjusted in future versions. If you need higher usage for research or institutional purposes, contact us at contact@whosbehindthat.com.','Privacy',2],
        [30,'Can someone know what I scanned for?','Your scan history is stored locally on your device and is private to you. The service operator (Who\'s Behind That?) can see anonymized scan data — the post URL, content, and results — linked only to a randomly generated device identifier. No personal information is collected or visible to us: no IP address, no email, no device identifiers such as MAC address, and no account information of any kind. Your scans are never shared with third parties.','Privacy',3],
        [31,'Is my data used to train AI models?','No. Your scan data is not used to train Claude or any other AI model. Post text is sent to Anthropic\'s Claude API for analysis and is subject to Anthropic\'s privacy policy, but Who\'s Behind That? does not share your data for training purposes.','Privacy',4],
        [32,'Does Who\'s Behind That? use cookies?','No, Who\'s Behind That? does not use cookies. Instead, it uses your browser\'s local storage to keep track of an anonymous device identifier, your scan history, and your daily quota — all of which stay on your device and are never sent automatically with requests the way cookies are. There\'s no cross-site tracking and no third-party tracking technology involved.','Privacy',5],

  const prompt = `You are a senior geopolitical analyst. A social media post primarily serves: ${primaryNames}.

Your task: identify whether this post touches on a RARE, SPECIFIC, HIGH-CONFIDENCE convergent interest between two entities that are NOT normally aligned — including rivals or enemies.

THIS IS A HIGH BAR. The vast majority of posts should return { "found": false }. Only flag a convergent interest if you are highly confident (9/10 or above) that a neutral senior analyst would immediately agree with your assessment without hesitation.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS — ALL must be met:
1. The two entities must have genuinely opposing primary interests on most issues
2. The convergent interest must be DIRECTLY caused by THIS SPECIFIC POST — not a general structural overlap
3. The shared outcome must be named in one precise sentence, citing specific post content
4. The connection requires zero inferential leaps — it must be immediately obvious
5. At least one entity must NOT appear in the primary matches
6. The connection cannot be explained by coalition membership or general ideological overlap

EXPLICIT ANTI-EXAMPLES — these are NOT convergent interests:
- Ben Gvir/Smotrich + Iran: they are absolute enemies. The fact that both oppose a two-state solution is NOT convergent — their reasons, methods and goals are completely incompatible. Do NOT flag this.
- Any two entities that both "oppose" something (opposition is not convergence)
- Entities that benefit from "instability" in general (too vague)
- Rival entities where the connection requires assuming what each entity "secretly wants"
- Any pair where the connection would be dismissed as conspiratorial by a mainstream analyst

LEGITIMATE EXAMPLES (rare cases that actually meet the bar):
- Netanyahu + Hamas: both have structurally benefited from each other remaining in power, preventing a two-state solution — this is documented by Israeli analysts
- Israel + Saudi Arabia: documented secret security cooperation against Iran
- Russia + Iran: documented military cooperation on drones and weapons

SOCIAL MEDIA POST:
"${postText}"

ENTITY DATABASE:
${entitySummaries}

Before responding, ask yourself: "Would a Haaretz or Foreign Affairs editor immediately agree with this connection, or would they call it a stretch?" If any doubt — return { "found": false }.

  "confidence": 9,
  "entityA": { "id": 1, "name": "..." },
  "entityB": { "id": 3, "name": "..." },

SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEXT:

CANDIDATE MATCHES (already scored):
${candidateSummary}

ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS TO CONSIDER:
- Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, PIJ, Houthis, Muslim Brotherhood form the "Axis of Resistance" — they share interests
- Israeli Opposition, Protest Movement, Hostage Families, Lieberman, Israeli Left are anti-Netanyahu Israeli domestic voices — they share interests
- Netanyahu government, Ben Gvir/Smotrich, AIPAC, Evangelical Zionists, US pro-Israel bloc share interests BUT have distinct sub-interests
- Palestinian Authority / Fatah and Hamas are RIVALS
- Israel and Iran are RIVALS
- US pro-Israel bloc (Trump, Rubio, Vance, AIPAC) and US Progressive Caucus (AOC) are RIVALS on this issue
- Russia and China benefit opportunistically but are not part of any primary bloc
- Human rights orgs (Amnesty, HRW, B'Tselem, ICC/ICJ) operate independently but often align with criticism of Israeli military conduct
- AOC/Progressive Caucus may align with human rights orgs and Israeli left — but NOT with Iran or Hamas

INTRA-COALITION DISTINCTION — CRITICAL:
Entities in the same broad coalition can have conflicting sub-interests. Treat them as distinct:
- A post criticizing Netanyahu from the RIGHT (settlers demanding harder enforcement, sovereignty language, West Bank infrastructure) aligns with Ben Gvir/Smotrich and the Settler Movement — but NOT with Netanyahu himself, who is being criticized
- A post criticizing Netanyahu from the LEFT (hostage deal, judicial reform, democratic norms) aligns with Israeli Opposition/Protest Movement — but NOT with Iran or Hamas even if they also oppose Netanyahu
- Ben Gvir/Smotrich and Netanyahu share a coalition but have genuine tension — settler posts that demand action Netanyahu hasn't taken align with the former, not the latter

TASK:
1. Identify the single most coherent political direction this post serves
2. Keep entities that genuinely fit that direction (including legitimate secondary/collateral beneficiaries)
3. REMOVE entities that belong to rival blocs or whose specific interests don't fit this post's framing
4. You may adjust the "alignment" field (primary/secondary) based on your coherence assessment
5. Maximum 3 primary, 2 secondary in your final output

CRITICAL: A post criticizing Netanyahu may align with Israeli opposition AND human rights orgs AND AOC — that is coherent. But it should NOT align with Iran or Hamas. A settler enforcement post aligns with Ben Gvir/Settler Movement — but NOT with Netanyahu if he is being pressured.

  const prompt = `You are a senior analyst specializing in geopolitical influence operations, information warfare, and social media manipulation. Your task is to determine whose agenda a social media post serves, and what context it leaves out.

LANGUAGE NOTE:
The post may be written in English, Hebrew, or Arabic. Score based on semantic meaning and political intent regardless of the language. Do not penalize non-English posts. Key political vocabulary to recognize:
- Hebrew: ביביזם (Bibiism/blind Netanyahu loyalty), פלישה (invasion/encroachment), ריבונות (sovereignty), יהודה ושומרון (Judea and Samaria/West Bank), אכיפה (enforcement), מאחז (outpost), עסקת חטופים (hostage deal), מחאה (protest)
- Arabic: مقاومة (resistance), شهيد (martyr), الاحتلال (the occupation), النضال (the struggle), محور المقاومة (Axis of Resistance), التطبيع (normalization), الاستيطان (settlement)

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
The primary concern is not whether a post contains outright lies, but whether it tells only half the story to serve a specific agenda. A post can be factually accurate and still be pure propaganda if it selectively presents only the facts that serve one side. Identify: (1) whose hidden interest this post serves directly, (2) who indirectly benefits from the post being spread, and (3) what relevant context is conspicuously absent.

SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEXT:
"${postText}"

ENTITY DATABASE (score ALL of these — do not skip any):
Field key: N=narrative (public stance), I=interest (hidden strategic interest), M=modus operandi (known tactics), C=comments
${entitySummaries}

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH entity above, assess three dimensions:

1. interest_score (0-100) — MOST IMPORTANT (weight: 55%)
   "Would spreading this post advance this entity's HIDDEN strategic interest?"
   Consider TWO angles — apply whichever is stronger, or combine if both are present:
   a) CONTENT: Does the post's message, framing, or narrative directly serve this entity's interests?
   b) CONTEXT: Does the post attack, undermine, or discredit someone this entity considers a rival or opponent?
      ONLY apply context scoring if ALL three conditions are met:
      - A specific named or unmistakably identifiable target is being attacked
      - That attack is CENTRAL to the post (not incidental or passing)
      - The rival relationship between that target and this entity is documented in the entity list above
      If context scoring applies, weight it according to how explicit and central the attack is:
      - Very direct, central attack on a named rival → strong context signal, weight heavily
      - Implied or between-the-lines criticism → weaker signal, weight moderately
      If context is the primary driver of the score, explain this clearly in the "why" field.

2. mo_score (0-100) — IMPORTANT (weight: 35%)
   "Does the construction of this post match this entity's known manipulation playbook?"

3. narrative_score (0-100) — WEAK SIGNAL (weight: 10%)
   "Does the post's surface content echo this entity's official public statements?"

Compute: combined_score = (interest_score * 0.55) + (mo_score * 0.35) + (narrative_score * 0.10)
Round to nearest integer.

IMPORTANT: Return ALL entities where combined_score >= 60.
The frontend will apply the 85% threshold for display.

PRIMARY vs SECONDARY ALIGNMENT:
After scoring, classify each match (combined_score >= 60) as either:
- "primary": This entity is a DIRECT beneficiary — the post appears to have been written with this entity's agenda in mind, consciously or not.
- "secondary": This entity is an INDIRECT or COLLATERAL beneficiary — the post was not necessarily written for them, but its spread still serves their interests as a side effect.

CRITICAL RULE — CRITICISM IS NOT ALIGNMENT:
If a post ATTACKS, CRITICIZES, or DELEGITIMIZES an entity, that entity scores LOW on primary alignment — being criticized does not serve your interest. A post mocking Netanyahu does NOT align with Netanyahu. A post exposing Hamas atrocities does NOT align with Hamas. Only score an entity high if spreading the post HELPS them.

CRITICAL RULE — COMPLETE THE BENEFICIARY CHAIN:
When a post attacks Entity A, always ask: who benefits from Entity A being weakened or discredited? If Entity A's rival (Entity B) is documented in the entity list, Entity B scores HIGH — even if Entity B is never mentioned in the post. This is the most commonly missed signal.
Examples:
- Post attacks Bennett, Lapid, Golan → Netanyahu scores high (his rivals are being delegitimized)
- Post attacks Netanyahu → Israeli opposition scores high
- Post attacks PA/Abbas → Hamas scores high
- Post attacks Hamas → PA/Abbas and Israel score high
Apply this chain for EVERY named target in the post. Never stop at "target scores low" — always follow through to "therefore rival scores high."

CRITICAL RULE — PREFERENCE LISTS AND RANKINGS:
When a post ranks or compares entities ("I prefer X over Y", "X is 1000 times better than Y"), the entity being elevated scores HIGH, the entity being dismissed scores LOW. A post saying "Netanyahu 1 over 1,000,000,000 Bennett/Lapid/Golan" strongly serves Netanyahu's interest and attacks his rivals — do not be confused by the list format. Score the beneficiary of the glorification, not just the targets of criticism.

CRITICAL RULE — SARCASM AND IRONY DETECTION:
Assume literal intent UNLESS the post contains explicit irony markers:
- Quotation marks around praise that reads as mockery
- A punchline or final line that contradicts the surface meaning
- Exaggerated praise that is internally inconsistent ("the greatest leader in all of history" style)
- Hebrew irony markers: "כן בטח", "בטח שכן", "ברור", used sarcastically
If none of these are present, score the post at face value. Do NOT second-guess straightforward political preference posts. The risk of misidentifying genuine support as sarcasm is greater than missing actual sarcasm.

CRITICAL RULE — INTRA-COALITION CRITICISM:
Entities in the same political coalition can still have distinct and sometimes conflicting interests. A post criticizing Netanyahu from the RIGHT (e.g. settlers or Ben Gvir demanding harder enforcement) does NOT align with Netanyahu — it aligns with the settler/nationalist bloc specifically. A post criticizing Netanyahu from the LEFT aligns with the Israeli opposition, not with Iran or Hamas even if they also oppose Netanyahu. Score each entity's specific interest independently, not by coalition membership alone.

Maximum 3 primary matches, maximum 2 secondary matches. If a match qualifies for both, assign it to primary only.
The "alignment" field is MANDATORY on every match — always set it to either "primary" or "secondary", never omit it or leave it blank.

For each entity with combined_score >= 60, provide:
- "alignment": "primary" or "secondary"
- "why": 2-3 sentences — for primary: which hidden interest is directly served and which MO tactics are present; for secondary: how the post's spread indirectly benefits this entity
- "missing": 2-3 sentences on what relevant context this post conspicuously omits

For entities with combined_score < 60, still include them with scores but "why", "missing", and "alignment" can be empty strings.

Also assess (only needed once — include in first batch response):
- text_ai_score (1-10): probability the text was AI-generated
- text_ai_reason: one sentence of evidence

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no preamble, no markdown:
